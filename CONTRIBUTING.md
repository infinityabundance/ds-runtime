# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in ds-runtime.

This project is currently experimental and evolving. If you would like
to contribute, please:

- Prefer small, focused pull requests
- Keep public APIs (`include/ds_runtime.hpp`) minimal and well documented
- Match the existing code style (clang-format, RAII, no macros)
- Add or update examples if behavior changes

For larger changes (new backends, API extensions), opening an issue or
discussion before starting work is appreciated.
